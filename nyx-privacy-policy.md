# Privacy Policy — Nyx

## 1. Information We Collect
Nyx only collects the minimum data required to function:

**Data Stored:**
- User IDs
- Server IDs
- Moderation logs (warnings, mutes, etc.)

**Data NOT Stored:**
Nyx does **not** store:
- Message content
- DMs
- Personal information
- IP addresses
- Names, emails, or passwords
- Any sensitive data

The bot only accesses the data Discord already provides to bots.

---

## 2. Why We Collect Data
Data is collected only to:
- Enable moderation features
- Store server settings
- Keep bot functionality running

No data is sold or shared with third parties.

---

## 3. Data Removal
- Server owners may request deletion of any stored data by contacting the developer or removing the bot.
- Removing the bot may automatically delete stored data depending on future implementation.

---

## 4. Third Parties
Nyx only operates inside Discord.  
It does **not** send data to any outside services unless added in future bot updates (the policy will be updated if this happens).

---

## 5. Security
Reasonable steps are taken to keep data secure.  
However, no system is perfectly secure.

---

## 6. Changes to Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.  
Continued use of Nyx means you accept the updated policy.
